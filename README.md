# Arduino_Thermal_Sensor_IOT
 This repository includes all codes and links with steps to build a temperature sensor. Created for Sefitel 2021.2
 
 In this project we connected a DHT11 sensor to Firebase using an ESP8266 WiFi Module and an Arduino Uno Board. With that, we were able to display and work with this information in a simple platform developed in the format of a website to assist in the control and analysis of temperature, especially in environments with thermal insulation, reducing energy consumption, in order to assist in environmental protection.

 All the steps that you need to follow to conect your Arduino Board to Firebase using WiFi module can be performed following this tutorial: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/pulasthi-Narada/connecting-esp8266-to-firebase-to-send-receive-data-4adf66

 You also need to connect your sensor to send data to Firebase, and you can do this following this another amazing tutorial: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/pulasthi-Narada/send-multiple-sensors-data-to-firebase-using-esp8266-f2f38b.

 We thank Pulasthi Narada for all the instructions provided through both tutorials.

 All material that we used in this project:
 - 1 Arduino Board + USB Cable
 - 1 DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
 - 1 10K (Ohms) resistor
 - 1 Protoboard
 - 1 Serial WiFi Module ESP8266 ESP-01s
 - Jumpers
 - And a lot of time ;)
